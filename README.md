# Mini Calculator (C++)

A simple console-based **Mini Calculator** written in C++.
This project demonstrates core programming concepts while being small and easy to extend:
- `switch-case` for menu-driven control flow
- `exit()` for quick termination
- `system("cls")` / `system("clear")` for clearing the console (platform-dependent)
- Input handling and basic arithmetic operations
- Example of integer modulus and floating-point arithmetic

## Features
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%) — integer modulus by default
- Power (^)
- Exit using `E` or `e`
- Repeated operations via a loop
- Console cleared between operations for cleaner UI
